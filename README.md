# react-scripts-thtliife-mod

This package includes scripts and configuration used by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).  
The files in this set of scripts are organized in a slightly different manner to the official scripts in [create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), mainly in a domain style organization method, with domains in subdirectories under `src/parts`.

*CSS Modules and the webpack HotModuleReplacementPlugin is also enabled in these scripts.*

Usage: 
```bash
create-react-app --scripts-version react-scripts-thtliife-mod MyAwesomeApp
```
